            <b>URL </b>is an acronym for Uniform Resource Locator and is a reference (an address) to a resource on the Internet [1]
            
            <br><br>    
            <b>Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions</b> (MIME) is an Internet standard that extends the format of email to support:
            Text in character sets other than ASCII
            Non-text attachments: audio, video, images, application programs etc.
            Message bodies with multiple parts
            Header information in non-ASCII character sets [2]
            
            <br><br>
            The<b> Hypertext Transfer Protocol</b> (HTTP) is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.[3]
            <br><br>
            In computing, <b>Extensible Markup Language</b> (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. The W3C's XML 1.0 Specification and several other related specifications—all of them free open standards—define XML.[4]

            
            <br><br>
            <b>Extensible Hypertext Markup Language</b> (XHTML) is part of the family of XML markup languages. It mirrors or extends versions of the widely used Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the language in which Web pages are formulated.[5]
            
            <br><br>
            <b>HTML5</b> is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and current major version of the HTML standard.[6]
            
            <br><br>
            <b>JavaScript</b>, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production. It is used to make webpages interactive and provide online programs, including video games.[7]
            
            <br><br>
            <b>PHP</b> is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive backronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.[8]
            <br>
            
            <br><br>
            <b>JavaServer Pages</b> (JSP) is a technology that helps software developers create dynamically generated web pages based on HTML, XML, or other document types. Released in 1999 by Sun Microsystems, JSP is similar to PHP and ASP, but it uses the Java programming language.[9]
           
            <br><br>
            <b>Ajax</b> is a set of Web development techniques using many Web technologies on the client side to create asynchronous Web applications. With Ajax, Web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows for Web pages, and by extension Web applications, to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page. In practice, modern implementations commonly substitute JSON for XML due to the advantages of JSON being native to JavaScript.[10]
